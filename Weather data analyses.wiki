- Blog post: Plots for 1 station
  - When inspecting a single station, can we see that recent years have higher temperatures?
  - The daily data is just too noisy - so average over months.
  - Plotting the monthly average for each year is also too noisy, so plot per decade.
  - We are actually interested in the deviations from some baseline - use the average over all the available data and compute deviations relative to that.
  - Highlight the last two decades.
  - Here we can clearly see that the average monthly maximum temperatures of the last two decades are higher than the baseline (only one deviation is negative, all other are positive).

- [X] Create project repo
  - [X] Will be a python module, but use the same project layout as I use for R.
  - [X] Call it wda
  - [X] Start with just a python script and a git repo
  - [X] First function is load_station which takes as input the station name and the data folder path.
