GOAL - PLAN - CURRENT - NOTES - DUMP - ARCHIVE

*GOAL*
Learn Python Data Science tools with the GHCND data.

*PLAN*

- Basic investigation of missingness for single station.
- [[Basic Caching]]: Assume dataset and metric choices do not change.
- Basic missingness for all stations.
- Link with location for Geo-plots.
- [[Incubate names wda project]]

*CURRENT*

- Figure out version control for ipynbs - looks like it will be jupytext
- [[Initial Single Station]]: aggregate by month and aggregate by year.

*NOTES*

*DUMP*

- Figure out vim jupyter notebook integration - it looks painful.
- Test python in rmarkdown - it is also painful.
